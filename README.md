## 👨🏾‍💻 What I Do

I transform raw data into reliable insights. Currently specializing in **modern data stack engineering** with a focus on:

- **Data Modeling** → Dimensional modeling, slowly changing dimensions, data vault
- **Pipeline Orchestration** → Airflow DAGs, dependency management, error handling  
- **Analytics Engineering** → dbt transformations, incremental materialization, data quality
- **Cloud Infrastructure** → AWS data services, infrastructure-as-code, cost optimization

## 🎯 Current Mission

Transitioning into production analytics engineering after completing a **1-year intensive data science certification** and earning my **AWS Cloud Practitioner** certification. Building portfolio projects that solve real business problems with clean code and thoughtful architecture.

## 📈 What Makes Me Different

**🔍 Detail-Oriented Engineering**  
I don't just make pipelines work—I make them maintainable, testable, and cost-efficient.

**🧠 Business-First Mindset**  
Every technical decision traces back to business value. Data engineering isn't just moving data—it's enabling better decisions.

**📚 Continuous Learner**  
From data science certification to cloud engineering to analytics engineering—I'm always expanding my technical horizons.

**🌍 Global Perspective, Local Impact**  
Based in Nairobi, building skills that compete globally while looking to create impact locally.

## 💻 Philosophy in Code
```python
def approach_to_data_engineering():
    principles = {
        "quality": "Test everything, twice",
        "efficiency": "Automate the boring stuff",
        "clarity": "Code is read more than written",
        "impact": "Focus on business value"
    }
    return principles
```

## 💭 Philosophy

> *"The best data pipeline is the one you don't have to think about—it just works, scales, and alerts you when it doesn't."*

I believe in:
- **Automation over manual work** → If I do it twice, I automate it
- **Documentation as code** → Good docs prevent 3 AM debugging sessions
- **Test-driven development** → Catch bugs before they catch you
- **Incremental improvement** → Small wins compound into excellence

## 🎓 Certifications & Education

**AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** • 2024  
**ALX Data Science Tech Programs** • 1-Year Program • 2023-2024

## ⚡ Fun Fact

When I'm not building data pipelines, I'm probably:
- 🏃‍♂️ Running around Nairobi (currently training for a football tonourment)
- ☕ Experimenting with pour-over coffee (yes, I track the extraction ratios in a spreadsheet)
- 📖 Reading technical blogs 
- 🎮 Playing chess online (data analysis extends to opening theory!)

*I've written SQL queries that join 10+ tables without losing my sanity. My secret? CTEs, lots of CTEs.*

## 🤝 Let's Connect

I'm actively seeking **Analytics Engineer** or **Junior Data Engineer** roles where I can:
- Build scalable data infrastructure
- Work with modern data stack (dbt, Airflow, Snowflake, Databricks)
- Collaborate with data teams solving real problems
- Learn from experienced engineers

**Reach out if you're:**
- Hiring for analytics engineering roles
- Want to discuss data architecture
- Building something interesting in the data space
- Looking for collaboration on open-source data tools
